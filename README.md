# Credit_Card-Analysis-Project

The Credit Card Transaction Analysis Dashboard is a data-driven business intelligence project developed using Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize credit card usage patterns. The dashboard integrates raw transactional data, cleans and transforms it using Power Query, and applies DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations such as revenue, transaction volume, customer segmentation, and spending trends.

The primary objective of the project is to provide actionable insights into customer behavior, identify high-revenue segments, detect seasonal spending patterns, and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for business growth. By leveraging interactive visuals, filters, and drill-through features, decision-makers can explore the data in real time and make informed strategic decisions.
